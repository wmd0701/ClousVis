# CloudVis

This is the repo for course project Visualization 2021, ETHZ. 

The task is cloud data visualization. The project is mainly done in Unity3D and C# and some part of data pre-processing is done via Python and VTK.

The data comes from [SciVis Contest 2017](https://www.dkrz.de/SciVis) and it is too large to be uploaded on github. In case the data is no longer available on SciVis website, please ask one of contributors of this project for the data.



## Tips

As it takes some time to reproduce the visualization on Unity3D, it may help to have a look at the videos below.
